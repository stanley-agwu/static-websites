**If we're gonna walk though the woods**, we need a little path. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Anyone can paint. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. This is the fun part

Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Only eight colors that you need. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Little short strokes. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.

### It's most important

It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Those great big fluffy clouds. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.

Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Here we're limited by the time we have. Poor old tree. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. There we are.
