**Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.** Play with the angles. You have to make these big decisions. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Happy painting, God bless. Let's make a happy little mountain now. It's all a game of angles. A happy cloud.

Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Very easy to work these to death.

If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. There comes a nice little fluffer. Trees grow however makes them happy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. That easy. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Put it in, leave it alone. Now then, let's play. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
