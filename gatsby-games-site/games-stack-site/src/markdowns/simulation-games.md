**We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.** Anyone can paint. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It all happens automatically.

We'll do another happy little painting. Play with the angles. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Just use the old one inch brush. Let's make a happy little mountain now. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

### Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. There he comes. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Let's have a nice tree right here. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.

Just make a decision and let it go. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Trees grow however makes them happy. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Look at them little rascals.
