**From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting** and God bless, my friends. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Son of a gun. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. A little happy sunlight shining through there. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Just a little indication. See there how easy that is.

### Play with the angles

You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. A happy cloud. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. You gotta think like a tree. Have fun with it. And just raise cain. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. And maybe a little bush lives there.

How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. At home you have unlimited time. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.
