**Even the worst thing we can do here is good.** You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. At home you have unlimited time. You need the dark in order to show the light. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. It's important to me that you're happy. With practice comes confidence.

You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Learn when to stop. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. You can do it. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

###  I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera

Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. There we go. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. It takes dark in order to show light. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Just a little indication. Just beat the devil out of it.

The least little bit can do so much. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Little short strokes.

Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
