**There comes a nice little fluffer.** This is a fantastic little painting. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Working it up and down, back and forth. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Use what you see, don't plan it.

### Whatever it takes. Learn when to stop.

Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Play with the angles. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Don't fight it, use what happens. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.

We can fix anything. We'll make some happy little bushes here. We'll put a happy little bush here. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Just make a decision and let it go. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Don't be bashful drop me a line. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.
